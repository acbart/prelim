\section{Conclusion}

My research is focusing on motivating and scaffolding introductory computer science classes.
I seek to introduce new tools and approaches that can support large-scale, in-person classroom experiences while still appealing to the unique kinds of learners that approach computing in higher learning.
In this preliminary proposal, I describe the technical work and how it will be deployed and evaluated in a Computational Thinking classroom.
I anticipate that this approach to introductory computing will provide useful new techniques and tools instructors.
Adoption of the materials will vary widely, with some instructors taking the curriculum wholesale and some just using pieces of it.
However, the tools will be readily available and the experience will indicate how they can be used most effectively.
