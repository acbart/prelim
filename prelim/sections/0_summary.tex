\section{Summary}

This preliminary proposal explores introductory computing contexts, and suggests a research plan to evaluate its motivational impact on students.
In particular, it focuses on the use of Datasets and Data Science as an introductory context as a holistically motivating context that can authentically appeal to a wide ranger of learners.
I propose to design pedagogical materials and technologies to integrate datasets into courses.
This research will move past traditional research on using data science for education, which currently is limited to brief case studies with little to no evaluation.
Instead, it will focus on serious evaluation and the principled, detailed analysis of how the affordances, issues, and value of this context.
It will be comparative to existing research on other introductory contexts such as Media Computation or Game/Animation Design.
Additionally, it will have a strong focus on new technological solutions to support the learning process, leveraging computational techniques in software engineering and data analysis.
It will also contribute to the ongoing research onto the effect of motivation on academic success, in particular the novel application of the MUSIC Model.
