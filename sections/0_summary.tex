\section{Summary}

My research is focused on motivating and scaffolding introductory computing experiences.
Non-traditional computing students in courses such as Computational Thinking pose a unique challenge because of their limited motivation and skill, and the scale of such classes.
To overcome these limitations, I propose a novel block-based programming environment leveraging mutual language translation to authentically transition students from the block-based code to a text-based programming language.
The system will use sophisticated program analysis to guide students to success and report learner progress to instructors.
The tool will synergize with a large collection of beginner-friendly big data sources in order to authentically contextualize the learning experience and thereby improve learner motivation.
Data will be gathered on students' motivation and learning progress and instructors' perceptions of the success of the tool in order to answer my hypotheses about the efficacy of the this approach and the tools that are developed to support it.
