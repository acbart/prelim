Non-blockly variables:
    Conceptual problem grades (assignments earlier in the semester where students answer in paragraphs)
    Demographics
        Year, Major/College, Gender, Prior programming
    Motivational
        Empowerment, Usefulness, Success, Interest, Caring
    Final project grades
    In successful cohort? (some cohorts are more social and closer to the ideal model than others)
    Attendance
    Book views (i.e. what pages in the book they have read, how many times they have loaded that page)

Blockly variables:
    Number of blocks used
    How many tests they pass (output checking, state checking, static analysis, unit testing)
    Number of submissions they used
    Number of times they were simply observing code (rather than editing it)
    Number of Non-linear problem completion (bouncing around)
    Total amount of time on a problem
    The ZSS edit distance over the course of the problem's submission trees
    Hours outside of class they worked
    Proximity of hours to submission date
    
Questions:
    Compare behavior within cohort for signs of assistance - times when one computer has motion and the other doesn't
    Compare this over the course of the semester, especially at crucial junctures
    Can we break students into clusters of ability level, so we can give them targetted instruction?
    Compare this to the Black Box project's data, or to similar kinds of data from Snap/Scratch people
