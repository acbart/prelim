    Designers - Designing Pedagogical Datasets
    Researchers - Understanding Data Science as a Context
Data Science is a popular intro context
    Particularly to engage non-majors
    
    Strongly connected to programming
        Easily aligned with objectives
        Flexible difficulty
    Useful/"Authentic" - A modern skill (The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century)
        Connect to their personal interests
        Freedom to explore
Prior Research
    Sinbad, Anderson, BRIDGES
    Highlight CORGIS study
        Collection of 44 datasets related to X, Y, and Z
        Curated and documented
        Used in a Computational Thinking class for non-computing majors
    Prior work
        Published (Spring 2016)
        Presented (Fall 2016)
        New data (Fall 2016+Spring 2017+Fall 2018, ~300 students)
    Results largely confirm prior work:
        Data Science is still the most popular context from the survey, significantly so
        Usefulness of learning to work with real-world data is higher than learning to program
        Intent to Continue Learning is most strongly correlated with their perceptions about Programming (usefulness, interest, success) and not working with real-world data

What is Data Science?
    Content
        A process of iteratively exploring data to answer questions
        Informed by programming, statistics, domain knowledge
        Much discussion about what exactly to teach - statistics? machine learning? munging?
    Context
        Anchor story
        A motivational tool for engaging students (learn more, work longer, say they had fun on surveys)
        Minimal addition to Learning Objectives
Pedagogical Datasets
    A dataset specifically targetted at novices for learning purposes
    Not necessarily for teaching data science

Pedagogical Dataset Development Process
    Think Software Engineering
Pragmatics of Pedagogical Datasets
    Getting started
        Think about audience
        Think of scope (Freedom vs. Structure)
            Students find their own dataset
            Choose from a list of prepared datasets
            Use a specific dataset
            Less -> More control
            Less -> More freedom
            Easier to grade, more opportunities for creativity
        Standardize your process early
            Clean workspace
            Have conventions
            Break into phases
            Structure and organization
            Bug tracking
        Learn the context
    Collecting Data
        Hunting sources
            Filtering and searching
            Google/Search Engines
            Meta-lists
            GitHub
            DataIsPlural
        File Formats
            Open (CSV, JSON) <--> Closed (tools like PDF Extraction, OCR)
        Scraping/Mining
            Legality
        Mash-ups
    Restructuring
        Options? Primitive Types, Heterogenous Collection, Homogenous Collection
        Target structure (standardize?)
        Layering
        Indexing
        Collapsing data/pivoting using an aggregate function/Binning
        Stacking data
    Manipulating
        Standardized Fields
        Naming (as hard as naming variables)
        Missing Data - imputation, null values
        Manual cleaning
        Mathematical transformations (e.g., standardizing, log transform)
    Data Representation
        Numbers,
        Text - apply extra analyses
        Dates and Times
        Measurements
        Locations
        URLs
        Enumerated Data
    Documentation
        Nobody reads the documentation
        Structure's complexity (Data Explorer)
        Data's complexity (Preliminary analysis with histograms)
    Data dissemination
        File size
        Availability
        Closed or open?
        Downloading, installation, opening
        Versioning
        Bit decay
    Evaluation
        Did students use it?
        Did students enjoy it?
        Did they understand it? Did they know what to do when confused?
        Did they have enough options?
        Revise it
