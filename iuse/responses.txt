1. Project Plan

One of the reviewers said:

"While all the parts of the project are interesting and valuable, it's
not completely clear that they tie together well.  At times, this feels
like a bit of a hodge podge of approaches.  There is also a *lot* of
work planned - five tools for the data system and a complex learning
analytics system seem challenging.²


Realizing that 15 pages is not Œenough¹ who would you respond to the above?

* There is significant prior work to build upon here - CORGIS has been in development for years, and there have already been several iterations of BlockPy. OpenDSA is a platform that's been in development for years.

2. Dissemination
Reviewers were concerned with Dissemination, I.e., the existing plan
focuses primarily on partner institutions.  Do you have plans for places
like Sigcse, workshops, etc.?

We have previously had two successful SIGCSE workshops on earlier version of CORGIS work and a Special Session on Instructional Design. We have published at SIGCSE, ITICSE, SPLASH-E, and COMPSAC-CELT about this work.

3. Evaluation

What is your response to the following concern:

³The panel noted that the project would be significantly strengthened by a
more careful evaluation plan that can assess each intervention
individually²
