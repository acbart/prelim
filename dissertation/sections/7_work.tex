\section{Work Plan}

First semester
More data sources
Computational Thinking course data collection
Were students more engaged?
Self-report (MUSIC model)
Behavioral
more time on task
getting started earlier
further projects
integration into their own major work
Did students learn more? (UNSURE)
Improved assessments?
Not really sure this can be proven empirically from the data without some kind of standard measure.
Second semester
More data sources
Repeate measures for Computational Thinking
CS-1114 (CS-1)
Learning outcome changes
Behavioral
Increased retention
More time on task
Self-report (MUSIC Model)
Did they want more game dev? More media computation? Less RealTimeWeb?
Third semester
Further data collection
