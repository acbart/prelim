\section{Proposed Research}

At this point, the largest job still ahead is data collectin to test the hypotheses.

Authentic Contextualization is important for learning
Learning gains have gone up - Concept Inventory? Grades? Test Scores? Gather some data in CS-2 (to indicate transfer)?
Authentic Contextualization is important for motivation
Retention has increased
Behavioral outcomes - retention increases, students report they do follow-ups (code academy, let's code blacksburg), students continue work in their free time, students start earlier
Self-report outcomes - pre/post survey on attitudes of computing improve, do they feel motivated during the course (MUSIC model might require some modifications to distinguish WHERE the motivation is coming from)
Our software will enhance this authentic contextualization
Through Big/Real-Time, Situated Data


Best practices for data source organization.



Add more Sources
Expanding to cover most majors
Simulation sources
Blockly integration
Blocks for real-time data
Python translation
CompThink book
Curriculum Units
In addition to libraries/data sets, we also provide problems
Set a clear path for "cracking them open" - useful for CS-3 professors interested in making their students tackle things more in-depth
