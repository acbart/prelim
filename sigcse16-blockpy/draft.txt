Introduction
    Problem: Students need scaffolding, but want to accomplish things and get to maturity
    Solution: A block-based environment that promotes transfer while allowing you to accomplish things.
        Block-based environments
        Interest, Usefulness, and motivation
        Data Science as a Context
BlockPy
    Data Science
        CORGIS datasets integration
        Visualization for graphs and plots
    Mutual Language Translation
        Mistuawaka citations
        Figure giving an overview of the toolchain
        Figure demonstrating the block-code conversion
        Describe the technical challenge of matching blocks and code
    Code Embedding
        Weintrop citations
    Data Explorer
        Reveals State over time
        Emphasis on name, type, value
        Also controls printer, loaded modules
    Guided Practice
        Concrete API Examples
    Instructor Tools
        Question Editing
        Dashboard

Research Study

    View of Blockly
        Data: Students are split between more/less blockly
    MLT:
        Few to no events for mutual language translation (only instructors demonstrating things)
        How do we make it intentional?
    Automatic Checker:
        Overall, lot's of positive feedback about this
        Some students reported the motivating remarks helpful, some reported them to be boring.
        One student was subverting it by abusing the output checking
Future work
    Technical Work
        Static/dynamic type inference to improve block rendering
        Support other contexts for comparison (e.g., turtles, processing)
    Research Questions
        How can the system promote transfer to a more mature environment?
        How can we rapidly get students familiar with a data source?
        How can we improve the teacher tools?
